Afterlife Adventure is a gentle foray into our mortality.
In this life we have no choice in being born, no choice in dying (at least, none that we know of or remember). I know, I know, such is the natural law. But it would feel nice to be asked. 
This is my fantasy about a world in which we can make some choices, and those choices are respected. The game might appear to be about death, but itâ€™s mostly a reason to think about everything I like about life.
